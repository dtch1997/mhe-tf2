MHE regularization for Tensorflow 2

This repository implements Minimum Hyperspherical Energy as described in this paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09298.pdf
It has been cleaned up and modularized so it can be added to any layer as a loss. 

The original implementation for Tensorflow 1 is available here: https://github.com/wy1iu/MHE/blob/master/code/architecture.py

## Getting started

See `example.py` for usage.
